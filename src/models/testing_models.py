"""Testing models for container-based test execution and quality analysis.

This module provides comprehensive Pydantic models for the testing system that supports
multi-language test execution in containerized environments. It includes models for
test requests, results, quality analysis, and container-based execution with security
controls and resource management.

The testing system supports:
- Multi-language test execution (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C++)
- Quality analysis with automated tool integration
- Resource limits and security controls
- Container-based isolation and execution
- Comprehensive result reporting with metadata

Key Model Categories:
    Request Models: TestRequest, QualityRequest, QualityScanRequest
    Response Models: TestResult, QualityResult, ContainerTestResult
    Configuration Models: ResourceLimits, TestSecurityLevel, TestType
    Factory Functions: Helper functions for creating model instances

Example:
    ```python
    from testing_models import TestRequest, TestResult, TestSecurityLevel, TestType

    # Create a test request
    request = TestRequest(
        code='def add(a, b): return a + b',
        test_code='def test_add(): assert add(2, 3) == 5',
        language="python",
        test_type=TestType.UNIT,
        security_level=TestSecurityLevel.HIGH,
        run_quality_check=True,
        timeout=30
    )

    # Process test result
    result = TestResult(
        test_id="test-123",
        success=True,
        stdout="Test passed",
        stderr="",
        exit_code=0,
        execution_time=2.5,
        created_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
        language="python",
        security_level=TestSecurityLevel.HIGH
    )
    ```

# ONE authority for "nothing ran is never a pass".
#
# There are two result models in this service and they use two different field
# names for the same fact:
#
#   * ``TestResult.no_tests_run``  - the executor `/execute` contract
#     (``CodeExecutionService`` / ``HTTPTestRunner``), added because a run that
#     collected ZERO tests arrived indistinguishable from a run in which
#     everything passed.
#   * ``TestExecutionResult.not_run`` - the orchestrator's own marker for an
#     unmapped ``(language, test_type)`` pair, which has no command to run.
#
# ``not_run`` was given the invariant "``not_run=True`` always implies
# ``success=False``" in prose only, and ``no_tests_run`` was given no invariant
# at all: it was POPULATED and never CONSULTED, so every caller that graded on
# ``result.success`` - which is every caller, including the ``/tests/execute``
# and ``/tests/batch`` responses returned verbatim to clients - could still read
# a suite that executed nothing as a pass.
#
# A per-consumer fix would have to be repeated at every consumer and would be
# incomplete the moment a new one is written. Instead the invariant is enforced
# ONCE, here, on the way INTO both models, so ``success`` is safe to read
# everywhere and the marker cannot be reduced to decoration again.
#
# NOT-RUN is deliberately NOT the same thing as FAILED. This coercion only
# removes the wrong PASS; it says nothing about whether a caller should call the
# outcome a failure. Callers that need the honest third value read the marker
# (or, for a suite, ``summary.verdict`` in the orchestration router).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Every spelling the "nothing was executed" fact arrives under.
#:
#: The eight language executors are independently maintained repos with no
#: shared schema, and they have already drifted: python/javascript/go emit
#: ``no_tests_run`` (the `/execute` contract spelling), while csharp and cpp
#: emit ``noTestsRun``. The orchestrator's own raw dicts use ``not_run``.
#: A reader that knows one spelling returns False for the others — which is
#: indistinguishable from "this executor reported that tests did run", i.e.
#: exactly the silent fake-green the marker exists to prevent.
#:
#: Tolerating the spellings here is deliberate: the contract cannot be
#: enforced upstream across eight repos, so it is absorbed at the one
#: boundary that every executor response crosses.

    # Mapping UNKNOWN onto not-run is the conservative reading and the correct
    # one: not-run means "nothing was verified", and an unverifiable run has
    # verified nothing as far as any caller can tell. It is never a pass and
